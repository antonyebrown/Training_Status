# Unit Training Status Dashboard

This Jupityr notebook will create a table of a unit's training status from from raw .csv exports.

The goal is to have a semi-automated process that works from .csv files that the unit training manager can download. Then, the analyst simply has to drop the files into the appropriate folder on a weekly (or any timeframe) basis, and run this workbook. The resulting table will be linked to Tableau for visualization.
